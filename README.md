# Tree Species App
Cross-platform mobile application for the mapping of tree species I made for the city where I studied.

## How it was made

**App**: Ionic 2+, Angular, TypeScript, HTML, SASS, SQLite, Leaflet.js

**Backend & API**: WordPress, Custom Post Types, PHP


## Try it out
1. Clone this repo.
2. run `npm install`.
3. `cordova platform add yourplatform`
    * *SQLite is not supported by the browser so the app won't work.*
    * *`File` & `Transfer` won't work using Ionic DevApp so the images won't be download and displayed).*
4. Install and run it on your device!
